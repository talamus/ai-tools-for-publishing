# Texts to be translated

Insert your original manuscript to this folder (or its subfolders) in markdown format.

Order the chapters with numbers, f.ex.:

```text
000_intro.md
010_the_first_chapter_part_1.md
011_the_first_chapter_part_2.md
012_the_first_chapter_part_3.md
020_the_second_chapter.md
030_the_third_chapter_part_1.md
031_the_third_chapter_part_2.md
...
```

Size of each file must be well under the token limit of the translator you are using.
