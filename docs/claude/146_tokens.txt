Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy. These organisms use sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to produce glucose (a type of sugar) and oxygen. The process occurs primarily in the chloroplasts of plant cells, where chlorophyll, a green pigment, absorbs light energy. This energy is then used to drive a series of chemical reactions that ultimately result in the production of glucose, which serves as food for the plant and can be stored for later use. Oxygen is released as a byproduct of this process, making photosynthesis crucial for maintaining Earth's atmosphere and supporting life on the planet.
